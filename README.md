*iOS Audio Visualizer*

Coded in one weekend as part of the San Luis Obispo iOS App Challenge.

Displays dancing particles, which will move faster/slower and appear to pop out in response to a song's beat and volume. Particles also change colors over time and randomly change their individual patterns. In addition, movement patterns will switch between rising, falling, and random movement.

In part adapted from/inspired by [SimpleMusicVisualizer](https://github.com/ultragtx/SimpleMusicVisualizer).
